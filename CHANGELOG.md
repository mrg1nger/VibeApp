# Changelog

The version goes up with each improvement that ships: the middle number for new features, the last for fixes only. Settings shows the version a computer is running.

## 0.3.1 (2026-11-09)

Security check before the code goes public:
- **Links can only open web pages or email.** The window used to hand any kind of link (file:, ms-…: and other program launchers) to Windows, and nothing stopped it leaving VibeApp's own screens.
- **Pairing codes can't be guessed from many addresses.** After 20 wrong codes from anywhere in 10 minutes, pairing pauses for everyone and the code changes.
- **Remote access "This computer" mode only answers to localhost**, so a website can't reach it by pointing its own name at this computer (DNS rebinding).
- Updated dependencies with known security problems (zod and others); `npm audit` finds none in what the app ships.
- The node-pty patch holds only its one real change, no build files.

## 0.3.0 (2026-11-09)

Cline (on the ClinePass plan) joins Claude and Codex:
- **Background jobs on Cline.** Saving memory, the tidy-up, the project brief, file summaries and chat summaries no longer use Claude's plan. Haiku steps in if Cline can't do one.
- **Claude can hand straightforward work to Cline** (`run_cline_subtask`). Codex reviews what Cline changed.
- **Cline takes a request when Claude and Codex are both out.**
- **Safety:** every Cline tool call goes through VibeApp's check. Cline works only inside the project, destructive commands are swapped for a "blocked" message, and the account connectors (Gmail, Drive) are switched off and refused.
- **Settings → Cline (ClinePass):** on/off for each use, the models, and Test Cline.
- **The usage report counts Cline separately.** New evaluations: `npm run eval -- helpers` and `VIBEAPP_EVAL_BUILDER=cline`.

## 0.2.0 (2026-11-09)

The first numbered step. Everything built up to here, including:
- Codex-led really hands off the work: Codex builds and tests, Claude plans and judges the report.
- Claude deploys with the saved Deploy (run_deploy), and Claude Code can too through the connector.
- Usage evaluations: every request recorded, Settings → Detailed report, `npm run usage`, `npm run eval`.
- Memory lives in the open project (🧠 Memory next to History).
- GitHub backup and sync, Schedules, Remote access, Deploy.

## 0.1.0

Everything before version numbers were stepped.
