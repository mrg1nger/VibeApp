# Changelog

The version goes up with each improvement that ships: the middle number for new features, the last for fixes only. Settings shows the version a computer is running.

## 0.4.1 (2026-11-10)

- **After an update, VibeApp says so once:** "VibeApp was updated to 0.4.2 (from 0.4.1)", with a What's new link. It starts with the update after this one, since versions before 0.4.1 didn't record which version ran last.

## 0.4.0 (2026-11-10)

VibeApp updates itself from GitHub Releases:
- **A banner when there's a new version,** across the top of every screen. It has a **What's new** link to the release page, **Update and restart**, **Skip this version** (a newer one still shows) and **Not now**.
- **Update and restart** downloads the new installer and checks it against the release's SHA-512. VibeApp then closes, installs it quietly and opens again. If a project is still working, it asks first.
- **Settings → Updates:** the running version, **Check for updates**, a link to all releases, **Look for new versions automatically** (on; at start and every 6 hours), and **Remind me again** for a skipped version.
- Remote browsers see the banner too, but installing happens on the computer.
- For whoever makes releases: `npm run release` publishes the packaged version with the files the updater needs, and the changelog section as the notes.

## 0.3.1 (2026-11-09)

Security check before the code goes public:
- **Links can only open web pages or email.** The window used to hand any kind of link (file:, ms-…: and other program launchers) to Windows, and nothing stopped it leaving VibeApp's own screens.
- **Pairing codes can't be guessed from many addresses.** After 20 wrong codes from anywhere in 10 minutes, pairing pauses for everyone and the code changes.
- **Remote access "This computer" mode only answers to localhost**, so a website can't reach it by pointing its own name at this computer (DNS rebinding).
- Updated dependencies with known security problems (zod and others); `npm audit` finds none in what the app ships.
- The node-pty patch holds only its one real change, no build files.

## 0.3.0 (2026-11-09)

Cline (on the ClinePass plan) joins Claude and Codex:
- **Background jobs on Cline.** Saving memory, the tidy-up, the project brief, file summaries and chat summaries no longer use Claude's plan. Haiku steps in if Cline can't do one.
- **Claude can hand straightforward work to Cline** (`run_cline_subtask`). Codex reviews what Cline changed.
- **Cline takes a request when Claude and Codex are both out.**
- **Safety:** every Cline tool call goes through VibeApp's check. Cline works only inside the project, destructive commands are swapped for a "blocked" message, and the account connectors (Gmail, Drive) are switched off and refused.
- **Settings → Cline (ClinePass):** on/off for each use, the models, and Test Cline.
- **The usage report counts Cline separately.** New evaluations: `npm run eval -- helpers` and `VIBEAPP_EVAL_BUILDER=cline`.

## 0.2.0 (2026-11-09)

The first numbered step. Everything built up to here, including:
- Codex-led really hands off the work: Codex builds and tests, Claude plans and judges the report.
- Claude deploys with the saved Deploy (run_deploy), and Claude Code can too through the connector.
- Usage evaluations: every request recorded, Settings → Detailed report, `npm run usage`, `npm run eval`.
- Memory lives in the open project (🧠 Memory next to History).
- GitHub backup and sync, Schedules, Remote access, Deploy.

## 0.1.0

Everything before version numbers were stepped.
